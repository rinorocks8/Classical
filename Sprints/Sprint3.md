## **Backend**

### **User Stories**

1. Create a database
   This task is done when the developer is able to see a defined database structure within mySql
   ~1h
2. Setup Go dev environment
   This task is done when the developer can run a simple Go program through VSCode
   ~1h
3. Establish database schema
   In mySql, create neccessary key relationships between tables and make sure each table has relevant information
   This task is done when the developer can use SQL queries to navigate through the relational tables created
   ~1h

### Backend Unit Test Cases

- TestGetClasses
  Tests that the http request can be sent across to the database and the correct json output is received

- TestCreateClass
  Should send a json object and a class will be created and stored in the database. Json object of the new class is sent back

- TestDeleteClass
  Should send a request with the class name that is to be deleted attached and that class will be deleted

- TestCreatePost
  Should send a json object with the post information inside and the new post will be stored in the database

- TestGetPostsByClassID
  Should send a request with the class ID as a variable and the posts will be returned as a json oject

- TestGetClassesByName
  Should send a request with the class name as a variable and the class will be returned as a json object

- TestGetTrendingClass
  Should send a request and a json object with the classes listed in descending order based on total_votes will be sent back

### Updated Backend API Documentation

## _Prequisites_

1. Install MySQL
2. Startup MySQL
3. Connect to SQL localhost at port 3306 in MySQL workbench
   -username: root
   -password: password123
   WARNING: may have to edit above credentials this based on SQL database computer settings
   -This can be done by editing the file "db/db.go" and the statement _DB, err = sql.Open("mysql", "{username}:{password}@tcp(localhost:{port})/{schemaName}")_

4. Create SQL schema named "classical"
5. Run SQL queries in "data-access/create-tables.sql" to create the necessary tables by copy pasting the commands
6. Install Go
